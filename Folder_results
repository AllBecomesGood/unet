Git ignores empty folders, but I don't want to upload this large data in them.
The project needs:
- a Folder called "results" where it stores the output prediction images.
- a Folder called "npydata" where it stores the loaded images and masks as .npy files.
- a Folder called "TumourData" where the MRI scan data is.
